*Check screenshot for sample swagger outputs


*ClassLibrary1: it only has VideoManager that uses accord.video.ffmpeg which is giving a problem when trying to use it with a web api.
however, the library was tested successfully in the console app: ConsoleApp_STD. 
(screenshot of the output can be found in the screenshot folder)




Remaining Tasks:

	*Organize the projects (delete the console apps probably)

	*Make accord.video.ffmpeg work with API (error: cant load .dll files although they are present in the project)
	 Error screen can be found in the screenshots folder.
	 I tried building and running the projects in 32 bit settings but still gives the same problem. 
	 I will continue to search for a solution for this
