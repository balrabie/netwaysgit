*Check screenshot for sample swagger outputs


*Ignore the console apps


*Ignore ClassLibrary1: it only has VideoManager that uses accord.video.ffmpeg which is giving a problem when trying to use it with a web api.





Remaining Tasks:

	*Organize the projects more

	*Make accord.video.ffmpeg work with API (error: cant load .dll files although they are present in the project)
	 Error screen can be found in the screenshots folder.
	 I tried building and running the projects in 32 bit settings but still gives the same problem. 
	 I will continue to search for a solution for this
